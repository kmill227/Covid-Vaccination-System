The experience in the group so far has been fairly straightforward, although there have been some obstacles that we faced along the way including how to 
handle some domain analysis problems. One thing that has changed as we moved on was how we handled the payment class. Initially we were 
going to just have it as a data member of other classes but we realized it needed it's own methods so we implemented a class for it. 
The same thing happened for the insurance class.
